1. Ps.c file is the code that print PID and process name also save that informations
in txt file. (Need more modification, too many repeated PID and process name )
2. dleprocess.c is the code that kill the process when writ down the PID.
(first write how many times you want to kill and write down the PID to kill) 
3. execv.c is the code that I'm think of new way to get PID and extra informations.
(Need more modification)
