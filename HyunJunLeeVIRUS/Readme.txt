1. Ps.c file is the code that print PID and process name also save that informations
in txt file. (Need more modification, too many repeated PID and process name )
2. dleprocess.c is the code that kill the process when writ down the PID.//modified as requested
3. execv.c is the code that I'm think of new way to get PID and extra informations.
(Need more modification)
